As of 2011, the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city.[9]

        Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named.[10] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[11] During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State.
