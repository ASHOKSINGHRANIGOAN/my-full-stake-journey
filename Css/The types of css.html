    <h1>Jaipur</h1>
    formerly known as Jeypore, is the capital and the largest city of the Indian state of Rajasthan. As of 2011, the city has a population of 3.1 million, making it the tenth most populous city in the country. Located 268 km (167 miles) from the national capital New Delhi, Jaipur is also known as the Pink City due to the dominant color scheme of its buildings in old city.[9]

    Jaipur was founded in 1727 by Sawai Jai Singh, the Kachhwaha Rajput ruler of Amer, after whom the city is named.[10] It is one of the earliest planned cities of modern India, designed by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya.[11] During the British colonial period, the city served as the capital of Jaipur State. After Indian independence in 1947, Jaipur was made the capital of the newly formed state of Rajasthan in 1949.
    
    Jaipur is a popular tourist destination in India, forming a part of the west Golden triangle tourist circuit along with Delhi and Agra.[12] The city serves as a gateway to other tourist destinations in Rajasthan like Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Udaipur, Kota, Mount Abu and has two World heritage sites of Amer Fort and Jantar Mantar. On 6 July 2019, the city was named to the World Heritage Cities list.[13]
